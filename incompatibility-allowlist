# The incompatibility-allowlist is meant to circumvent schema validation when
# removing schemas from the schema repository. To use this, add a line that
# matches the convention `{namespace}.{doctype}.{docversion}`. Globs may be used.
# This is is only required for commits that introduce a schema deletion or allow
# for incompatible changes in columns.

# Example:
# telemetry.untrustedModules.*

# Bug 1689513
glean_js_tmp.*
