# A script for manually testing the validated schema generation function in the main
# schema generator script.
#
# Arguments:
#   $1  The source branch to use a base for generated schemas. For testing, you
#       may use something like `main~5` to use the 5th revision from the head
#       of main.
#   $2  The publish branch where commits are made with generated schemas. This
#       will typically be `test-generated-schemas` or `generated-schemas`.
#   $3  The base branch to use for validation. This is set to $2 by default, but
#       may take on a value like `generated-schemas~5`
#
